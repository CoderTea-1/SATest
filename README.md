# Implicit Bias App

This is a simplified recreation of the Harvard's [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) tests, using React and Redux. Tested with Node v12.13.0.

This uses a template created by [Marcela Rodriguez](https://github.com/arilaen/implicit-bias).
This is the frontend.
